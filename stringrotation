#Problem Statement

Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if a string 'a' can be obtained by 
rotating another string 'b' by 2 places.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. 
In the next two line are two string a and b.

Output:

For each test case in a new line print 1 if the string 'a' can be obtained by rotating string 'b' 
by two places else print 0.

#CODE

a = "fsbcnuvqhffbsaqxwp"
b = "wpfsbcnuvqhffbsaqx"
if(a[0:2]==b[len(b)-2:] or b[0:2]==a[len(b)-2:]):
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
