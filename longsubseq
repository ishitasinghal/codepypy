Problem Statement
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence 
present in both of them. Both the strings are of uppercase.

Input:
First line of the input contains no of test cases  T,the T 
test cases follow.
Each test case consist of 2 space separated integers A and B 
denoting the size of string str1 and str2 respectively
The next two lines contains the 2 string str1 and str2 .

Output:
For each test case print the length of longest  common subsequence 
of the two strings.

Example:
Input:
2
6 6
ABCDGH
AEDFHR
3 2
ABC
AC

Output:
3
2

#CODE

testcases = input()
for _ in range(int(testcases)):
    l1, l2 = input().split()
    string1 = input()
    string2 = input()
    count = 0
    for i in string1:
        if(i in string2):
            count = count+1      
    print(count)
