Problem Statement
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence 
present in both of them. Both the strings are of uppercase.

Input:
First line of the input contains no of test cases  T,the T 
test cases follow.
Each test case consist of 2 space separated integers A and B 
denoting the size of string str1 and str2 respectively
The next two lines contains the 2 string str1 and str2 .

Output:
For each test case print the length of longest  common subsequence 
of the two strings.

Example:
Input:
2
6 6
ABCDGH
AEDFHR
3 2
ABC
AC

Output:
3
2

#CODE

string1 = "ABCDGH"
string2 = "AEDFHR"
count = 0
# res = [string1[i: j] for i in range(len(string1)) for j in range(i + 1, len(string1) + 1)] 
for i in string1:
    if(i in string2):
        count = count+1      
print(count)
