The task is to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. 
An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the 
order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are anagram of each other.

Print "YES" without quotes if the two strings are anagram else print "NO".

#CODE

string1 = "radhakrishna"
string2 = "kriradshhana"
for i in string1:
    if(i in string2 and len(string1)==len(string2)):
        print("ANAGRAM")
