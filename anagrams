Problem Statement

Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. 
The task is to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. 
An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the 
order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are anagram of each other.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
Each test case consist of two strings in 'lowercase' only, in a single line.

Output:

Print "YES" without quotes if the two strings are anagram else print "NO".

#CODE

string1, string2 = input().split()
for i in string1:
    if(i in string2 and len(string1)==len(string2)):
        flag=1
    else:
        flag=0
if(flag==1):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
