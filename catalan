Problem Statement

Given a number N. The task is to find the nth catalan number.
The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ are 
1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, â€¦

Input:

First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes 
the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains 
a single integer N.

Output:

For each test case, in a new line print the catalan number at 
position N.

Example:

Input:

3
5
4
10

Output:

42
14
16796

Catalan number:
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in 
many interesting counting problems like:
Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses 
which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are 
((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).

#CODE

# for given number of testcases

testcases = int(input())
def catalan(n):
    result = 1
    i = n * (n - 1)
    while n >= 1:
        result = result * n
        n = n - 1
    return result

for _ in range(testcases):
    num = int(input())
    print(catalan(2 * num) // (catalan(num + 1) * catalan(num)))
