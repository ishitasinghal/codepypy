Problem Statement

Given two strings X and Y. The task is to find the length of the longest common substring.

Input:

First line of the input contains number of test cases T. 
Each test case consist of three lines, first of which contains 2 space 
separated integers N and M denoting the size of string X and Y strings respectively. 
The next two lines contains the string X and Y.

Output:

For each test case print the length of longest  common substring of the two strings .

#CODE

testcases = input()
for k in range(int(testcases)):
    l1, l2 = input().split()
    string1 = input()
    string2 = input()
    lenlist = []
    res = [string1[i: j] for i in range(int(l1)) for j in range(i + 1, int(l1) + 1)] 
    for i in res:
        if(i in string2):
            lenlist.append(len(i))
    if(lenlist == None):
        print(0)
    else:
        print(max(lenlist))
