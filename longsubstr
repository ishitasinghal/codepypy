Problem Statement

Given two strings X and Y. The task is to find the length of the longest common substring.

Input:

First line of the input contains number of test cases T. 
Each test case consist of three lines, first of which contains 2 space 
separated integers N and M denoting the size of string X and Y strings respectively. 
The next two lines contains the string X and Y.

Output:

For each test case print the length of longest  common substring of the two strings .

#CODE

string1 = "abcdgh"
string2 = "bhcdgheh"
lenlist = []
res = [string1[i: j] for i in range(len(string1)) for j in range(i + 1, len(string1) + 1)] 
for i in res:
    if(i in string2):
        lenlist.append(len(i))
print(lenlist)
