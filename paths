Problem Statement

The task is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom 
right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you 
can either move only to right or down.

Input: 

First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case 
consists of N and M, denoting the number of rows and number of column 
respectively.

Output: 

Single line output i.e count of all the possible paths from top left 
to bottom right of a mXn matrix. Since output can be very large number 
use %10^9+7.

Example:

Input:

1
3 3

Output:

6

#CODE

def fact(num):
    if(num==1):
        return num
    else:
        return(num*(fact(num-1)))
num = 2
print(fact(num))
