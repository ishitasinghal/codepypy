Problem Statement

Given a String of length S, reverse the whole string without reversing the 
individual words in it. Words are separated by dots.

Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. 
T testcases follow. Each case contains a string S containing characters.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, output a single line containing the reversed String.

Example:
Input:
2
i.like.this.program.very.much
pqr.mno

Output:
much.very.program.this.like.i
mno.pqr

#CODE

testcases = input()
for i in range(int(testcases)):
    sample = input()
    new = sample.split('.')
    new2 = new[::-1]
    print('.'.join(new2))
